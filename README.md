## About the systematic review
This repository contains scripts and data associated with a systematic review investigating how organizations manage and collaborate on data and metadata standards using the version control platform GitHub. The manuscript also makes several recommendations for organizing content within GitHub repositories to support collaboration and reuse of community-driven data standards.

## Getting started in this repository
The quickest way to explore the scripts and data supporting the manuscript and included in this repository is to run the Binder application by clicking the `binder` button at the top of this README file. This launches a virtual Jupyter notebook session (it may take a few minutes to load) where you can replicate analyses and reproduce plots that appear in the manuscript.

The home directory contains all jupyter notebooks and the `data` folder has CSV files will all datasets analyzed within the notebook.
